          <h1 id="Why-binary-debloating"><a href="#Why-binary-debloating" class="headerlink" title="Why binary debloating"></a>Why binary debloating</h1><ul>
<li>Most users don’t access to the source code.</li>
<li>Users may use the same software in dramatically different ways, the unnecessary features also vary from users to users. Therefore, the debloating process should take place after software deployment and should be tailored for each individual user.</li>
<li>Different from dead code removal because some unused functionalities will also be removed.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-debloat-binaries-and-challenges"><a href="#How-to-debloat-binaries-and-challenges" class="headerlink" title="How to debloat binaries and challenges:"></a>How to debloat binaries and challenges:</h1><ul>
<li>users provide a set of sample inputs to demonstrate how they will use the software.</li>
<li>modify the software binary to remove the unnecessary features while keeping the needed ones.</li>
<li>it is challenging for end-users (even developers) to provide an input corpus that exercises all necessary code that implements a feature.  Therefore, it’s important to identify the code that is necessary to required functionalities but is not executed when processing the sample inputs, which is called related=code and meanwhile include minimal functionally unrelated code.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="System-Design"><a href="#System-Design" class="headerlink" title="System Design"></a>System Design</h1><ul>
<li>Tracer: monitors the program execution with the given sample inputs to record (1) executed instructions, including their memory addresses and raw bytes; (2) the taken or non-taken of conditional branches; (3) concrete targets of indirect jumps and calls. With these collected execution traces, RAZOR disassembles the bloated binary and constructs the partial control-ﬂow graph (CFG).</li>
<li>PathFinder: utilizes heuristics to infer more <strong>related-code</strong> from the executed ones and expand CFG.<ul>
<li>If the non-taken target is already in the CFG, PathFinder permits the jump from branch instruction to that non-taken target. </li>
<li>If a new path does not include any call instructions, PathFinder includes all its instructions to the CFG.</li>
<li>If a new path has call instructions that invoke functions within the same binary or external functions that have been executed, PathFinder include all its instructions.</li>
<li>If a new path has call instructions that invoke external functions that have not been executed but have similar functionalities to one executed function (they manually check and group libraries’ descriptions to correlate library functions), they add all instructions in that path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generator: generates a new binary based on the output CFG of Tracer and PathFinder.<ul>
<li>disassembles the original binary following the expanded CFG -&gt;  modifies the pseudo-assembly to create a valid assembly file -&gt;  compiles the assembly fle into an object fle -&gt; copies the machine code from the object fle into a new code section of the original binary -&gt; modifes the new code section to fIx all references to the original code and data -&gt; sets the original code section non-executable to reduce the code size.</li>
<li>modifies the pseudo-assembly to create a valid assembly file: 1) Basic Block Symbolization, create the label L_addr for the basic block at address addr, then scan all direct jump and call instructions and replace their concrete target addresses with corresponding labels. 2) <strong>indirect call</strong>, The first method is to locate constants from the original binary that are used as code addresses and replace them with the corresponding new addresses, the second method is to perform the address translation before each indirect call. This paper takes the second approach. For local targets, they define a translation table (which is equivalent to a map) for each indirect call instruction; for global targets, they use a global translation function to find the correct module and then look up its translation table to get the correct new address to invoke. 3) if a debloated binary reach removed code or disabled branches, they redirect such attempt to a fault handler that exits the execution and dumps the call stack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results:"></a>Results:</h1><ul>
<li>Code reduction: On average, RAZOR achieves 68.19% code reduction for SPEC benchmarks and 78.8% code reduction for CHISEL benchmarks.</li>
<li>Functionality: RAZOR binaries produce the same results as those from the original binaries for all test cases of all programs, showing the robustness of the debloated binaries. CHISEL, a debloating tool they use to compare with RAZOR, only passes three.</li>
<li>Effectiveness of Path Finding: PathFinder effectively identifies related-code that completes the functionalities triggered by training inputs. They mention this aspect because finding new paths is their main contribution.</li>
<li>Security: RAZOR removes four CVEs from the original binaries and does not introduce any new bugs. RAZOR reduces 61.9% ROP gadgets, while CHISEL reduces 85.1% ROP gadgets. RAZOR prevents attackers from corrupting function pointers because function pointers are replaced with if_else.</li>
<li>Performance: On average, RAZOR introduces 1.70% overhead to debloated programs, indicating its efficiency for real-world deployment. </li>

          <p>This paper studies WebAssembly binary security. They find many classic vulnerabilities which are not exploitable in native binary code are exposed again in WebAssembly binaries. Linear memory, which is used by WebAssembly to store (non-scalar) data. is the root cause of WebAssembly binary vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>WebAssembly has four primitive data types (i32, i64, f32, f64), data that holds instances of the four types is called managed data and will be stored in managed memory. Managed memory is handled by the VM and under VM’s protection. On the other hand, non-scalar data such as string and array is stored in lineal memory, linear memory is allocated by the VM but under control of programs, a program can access (r/w) arbitrary addresses within linear memory.</p>
<p>Native binary code also accesses memory, to protect memory from malicious manipulations, there are some security mechanisms such as DEP and ASLR. However, many of the security mechanisms are missing in linear memory, as a result, exploitations which are already mitigated in native binary are dangerous in WebAssembly. Specifically, absence of <em>canary</em> and <em>safe unlinking check</em> makes it easy to exploit stack-based and heap-based buffer overflow. Exploiting stack-based buffer overflow can overwrite stack data (return address is not included since it resides in manage memory) or even heap and constant data because page protection is missing; Exploiting heap-based buffer overflow can lead to an arbitrary write. Malicious actions may be triggered further because of buffer overflow and overwriting. For example, this paper gives an example of XSS, which is triggered because constants are overwrote with stack-based buffer overflow, and an example of control flow hijacking, which is triggered due to an arbitrary write to index of indirect call with unlink attack.</p>
<p>Then, this paper studies real-world programs to investigate how programs suffer from vulnerabilities. The results show many functions use linear memory; thus, a lot of data is prone to be overwritten by buffer overflow or arbitrary write. Besides, there are many indirect calls, attackers may overwrite index of indirect call to diverge control flow. Although WebAssembly implements type check protection, there are still many functions which an attacker can choose from in a vtable.</p>
<p>The paper finally discusses possible mitigations that defeat attacks presented above. Separate stack, heap and constant data into multiple linear memories can prevent overflow from affecting data in another memory and makes constant data read-only, but how to  switch between different memories in a challenge; Use more vtables and limit the function number in each vtable can mitigate control flow divergence; Introduce new operations and properties for linear memory is another way but this incurs a performance overhead.</p>

          <p>Applications typically include code they don’t use. For example, some (indirect) libraries are not imported by first-party code. The unused code, also called code bloat not only increases application&#39;s size but has security implications. For example, attackers can find code snippets in unused code to build gadget chains and then perform code reuse attack. Since system calls are often used as part of exploit code, this paper mainly focuses on debloating libraries to disable unused system calls and then reduce the attack surface.</p>
<p>To remove unused code, a call graph is required to identify non-imported functions. However, because of indirect function invocations in C/C++, it is difficult to identify function dependencies accurately. Current implementations of call graph suffer from severe over-approximation, which can result in the inclusion of many functions that are not actually used. Besides, current debloating strategies consider the entire lifetime of a program as part of their analysis. they remove functions that will never be used at any point.</p>
<p>However, applications can split in to multiple phases, for example, server applications typically perform a series of operations before handling client request. Different phases perform different functionalities and some functions are only used in some specific execution phases. Take Apache as an example, the initialization phase begins performs operations such as binding and listening to socket, then it calls fork and the forked process starts server phases. The two phases call different system calls, if we consider the entire lifetime, then all of these system calls should be kept. However, in the serving phase many system calls are not used and they should be disabled. Otherwise, these system calls may be used to exploit the applications. Based on this, this paper proposes temporal specialization debloating, which aims to disable system calls not used by one execution phase.</p>
<p>To identify which system calls are required by each execution phase, they build a call graph. To resolve indirect call in C code, they first use the existing algorithm SVF Andersen&#39;s analysis to get an initial call graph, then they compare the type of arguments and type of parameters, they prone call edges if the types are inconsistent. Further, they collect all function addresses which have been taken before calling the (indirect) call site, since function pointers must be assigned to function addresses to call functions, if the address of candidate function is not accessible, then it will not he called by call site.</p>
<p>In addition to call graph of first-party code, they call build call graph for libraries and add system calls as leaves of the exported functions, then they integrate libraries call graph (which indicate system calls dependencies) into first-party call graph. By assuming all first=party functions in one specific execution phase as entry points, they can find system calls which are never reached by any first-party code and then disable those system calls.</p>
<p>The results show with these two methods, they prone over 50% wrong call edges in the initial call graph (SVF Anderson analysis). With that call graph and temporal specialization approach, they disable more system calls in serving phase and break about 10% more gadget chains. Some kernel CVEs are also mitigated because the related system calls are disabled.</p>

          <h1 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h1><p>General grey-box fuzzers (GBFs) cannot effectively detect concurrency-vulnerabilities. This paper presents a tool named MUZZ to detect multithreading-relevant vulnerabilities and bugs.</p>
<h1 id="Limitation-of-GBFs-Motivation"><a href="#Limitation-of-GBFs-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Limitation of GBFs (Motivation)"></a>Limitation of GBFs (Motivation)</h1><p>Existing fuzzing tools such as AFL only instrument the entry instruction of each basicblock as the basicblock&#39;s deputy. However, in the presence of thread-interleavings, the behaviors of one basicblock are non-deterministic. GBFs cannot distinct such diversities caused by thread-interleavings and this could reduce the overall effectiveness of fuzzing.</p>

<li>By assigning priorities to deputy instructions, Muzz selectively instruments instructions.<ul>
<li>Compute a probability for deputy instruction (which is either an entry statement of a basicblock or a thread-context instruction), then instrument deputy instruction with the computed probability.</li>
<li>Basicblocks with high CC and more security-sensitive instructions are assigned to a higher probability since they are prone to be vulnerable.</li>
